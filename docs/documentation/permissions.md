# ðŸ”’ Permissions

## Recommended for Players

- **notquests.use** â€” This is the default user command, which players need to play your quests. It's enabled by default, so make sure to deny this permission for your players if you don't want them to use your quests yet.

## Recommended for Admins

- **notquests.admin.armorstandeditingitems** â€” Gives the player permission to use quest editing items for armor stands. Only admins should have this.

- **notquests.admin** â€” Admin command to use the `/qa` command and do all the administrative tasks like creating and editing quests. This also automatically includes all previous permission above. You can do everything in the plugin with this permission.
