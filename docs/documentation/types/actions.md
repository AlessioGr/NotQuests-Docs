# üß® Actions

Raw actions can be created using `/qa actions`. Those will be saved in the `plugins/notquests/categoryname/actions.yml`. Actions are also Quest rewards or Objective rewards. An action is, as the name says, an action. Any action. Something "happens".

To "test" an action created via `/qa actions`, you can use `/qa actions edit actionname execute <Player Name(optional)>`. It can have the optional flag `--ignoreConditions` if you want to ignore any conditions attached to this action.

**Command Arguments for every action:**

- **`(flags)`** - Optional flags
  - `--category <categoryName>` - If this is a raw, actions.yml action, you are able to set its category here

## Default Variable Actions

These actions act as "vessels" for variables. What does that mean?

Well... for example, the NumberAction is such a variable action. In-game, it turns into as many actions as there are number variables, so it's a lot more actions than you think there are. Other than for conditions, not every variable is able to set a value. For example, the DayOfWeek can only be used as a condition, but not as an action.

Makes sense right? You can't just time-travel in real life with a Minecraft plugin. The variable "Money" however can be used as a condition AND an action, since you can see a Player's money, but also change it. In-game money of course ü•≤

Please consult the [Variables Section](/docs/documentation/types/variables) for those.

### ‚ùì Boolean

:::info Description

**What happens:** The value of this Boolean variable is set to either true or false

**Command Arguments:**

- **`<variable type>`** Type of the Boolean variable
- **`<variable arguments>`** Additional variable arguments which may or may not exist for this specific variable
- **`<operator>`** - Valid operators are `set` and `setNot`
- **`<expression>`** - What the variable should be. Common values are `true` or `false`, but you can also set it to a different boolean variables here.

**Example commands:**

- `/qa actions add actionname Flying set true` - Flying would be a Boolean variable type. This action would make the player fly.
- `/qa actions add pp3 Money add ((TagInteger(TagName:points)>=4)*(10+30))+(!(TagInteger(TagName:points)>=4)*5)` - This is just to show that very complex actions are also possible with NotQuests expression system. This action does the following: If your "points" (from the Integer tag) are bigger or equal 4, this action will give you 40$. Otherwise, it will give you 5$.

### üìô List

:::info Description

**What happens:** The value of this List variable is changed

**Command Arguments:**

- **`<variable type>`** Type of the List variable
- **`<variable arguments>`** Additional variable arguments which may or may not exist for this specific variable
- **`<operator>`** - Possible operators are `add`, `clear`, `remove` and `set`
- **`<expression>`** - What the variable should be. This depends on the variable type

### üíØ Number

- **`<operator>`** - Valid operators are `add`, `deduct`, `divide`, `multiply` and `set`
- **`<expression>`** - What the result of the variable should be. This expression is cool, because it can contain any kind of math expression. And it can even contain other number variables.

**Example command:** `/qa actions add actionname Money multiply 2` - Flying would be a Number variable type. This action would make the player fly.
**Example command with math expression + other variables**: `/qa actions add actionname Money set QuestPoints*Money+500-30/2`
**Example command with very advanced expression:** `/qa actions add actionname Money set 10+TagInteger(TagName:reputation)*TagInteger(TagName:level)`

### üÜé String

:::info Description

**What happens:** The value of this String variable is changed

**Command Arguments:**

- **`<variable type>`** Type of the String variable
- **`<variable arguments>`** Additional variable arguments which may or may not exist for this specific variable
- **`<operator>`** - Valid operators are `set` and `append`
- **`<expression>`** - What the result of the variable should be. This depends on the variable type, but it has to be a String (= text)

## Default Actions

These are the default, "standalone" actions and don't depend on variables.

- **Optional: `<amount>`** - Amount of times the other action should be executed.
- **`(flags)`** - Optional flags
  - `--ignoreConditions` - If you set this flag, all conditions added to the other action which should be executed will be ignored. It will be executed no matter if they are fulfilled or not.

**Example commands:**

- `/qa actions add actionname Action a1 2 --ignoreConditions` - This executes the action a1 two times, regardless of the conditions of action a1.
- `/qa actions add actionname Action a1,a2,money10 1` - This executes the actions a1, a2 and money10.
