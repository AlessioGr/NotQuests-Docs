## Player Placeholders

These are all the Player Placeholders you can use ([PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245/) required):

- %notquests_player_has_completed_quest_QUESTNAME%
- %notquests_player_has_current_active_quest_QUESTNAME%
- %notquests_player_is_objective_unlocked_and_active_OBJECTIVEID_from_active_quest_QUESTNAME%
- %notquests_player_is_objective_unlocked_OBJECTIVEID_from_active_quest_QUESTNAME%
- %notquests_player_is_objective_completed_OBJECTIVEID_from_active_quest_QUESTNAME%
- %notquests_player_questpoints%
- %notquests_player_active_quests_list_horizontal%
- %notquests_player_active_quests_list_vertical%
- %notquests_player_completed_quests_amount%
- %notquests_player_active_quests_amount%
- %notquests_player_tag_TAGNAME%
- %notquests_player_variable_VARIABLENAME%

If applicable, you will need to replace `QUESTNAME` with the name of the quest and `OBJECTIVEID` with the ID of the objective (visible in `/qa edit questname objectives list`).
