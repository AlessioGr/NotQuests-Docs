Say you have multiple NPCs with multiple quests attached to them. Now, let's create a reputation system for those NPCs!

## The idea

As you complete quests, your reputation for that NPC increases - and not just that! Your reputation for the NPCs nation will also increase. As you gain reputation, you will unlock more quests and better rewards for quests from that nation. NPCs from that nation will also let you in their homes and give you access to other secret locations.

## How to do that

Basically, we will use NotQuests powerful tag system for that, together with a smart combination of actions, conditions and the conversation system.

## The tag system 

NotQuests tag system allows you to save data per-player. That's it. Sounds simple, but it's super powerful. You can save integers (= numbers), floats/doubles (= numbers with decimal places), strings (= text) and booleans (= true or false) for each player.

With actions, we can modify the tags and with conditions, we can check the tags (& even do math with them or compare them to other variables and tags).

## Creating our first tags

We have three NPCs: Jon Snow (ID=0), Arya Stark (ID=1) and Cersei Lannister (ID=2).
